Things to fix
==============

* Chat Portraits for Subscribers

POST /software/imglib/ppost.asp?pid=user_pid&uid=user_id&ppass=users_password&picnum=random_generated_number HTTP/1.1
Host: www.gamespyarcade.com:28900

The above call is performed by GameSpy Arcade to allow a subscribed user to upload a chat portrait. 

Notes: The password is sent in clear text.  The picnum from above will need to be inserted into the `GameTracker`.`profiles` database replacing the column `pic` with the picnum from above.

Other requirements: May need to create a new database / table that accepts the uploaded image as a MySQL BLOB. Then have the pic column from `GameTracker`.`profiles` reference the BLOB ID using Foreign Keys.

* Chat Icons for Subscribers

Further notes
================

The above API end points that GameSpy Arcade utilizes may need to be combined under the `pic` column in `GameTracker`.`profiles` table. When a user logs into GameSpy Arcade the application automatically sends the following data:

[19:00:13] #gsp!subhome FalconSpy-gs BCAST \b_reg60\1
[19:00:13] #gsp!subhome FalconSpy-gs BCAST \b_look\720903,0

The first line is the client performing a subscriber look up and then setting a flag that the user is infact subscribed.

The second line containing "b_look" is the value of the portrait/icon. For example 720903 is a default image with GameSpy Arcade and the 0 means I do not have a chat icon uploaded. I am using the default that GameSpy Arcade gives me based on the coding of the application.
